            <h1 class="text-success">What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
            <p>SessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage. The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                expire,
                data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.Session storage is destroyed once the user
                closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</p>

            <h1 class="text-success">What is difference between global scope and local scope?</h1>
            <p>Global Variables − A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your
                JavaScript code. Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is
                defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.</p>

            <h1 class="text-success">How event loop works in javascript?</h1>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is
                empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
                effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

        <div class="pt-3">
            <h1 class="text-success">What is the type of undefined in JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
                undefined if a value was not returned .</p>
