        <h1>What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
        <p>SessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage. The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
            data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.Session storage is destroyed once the user
            closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</p>
